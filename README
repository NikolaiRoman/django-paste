===================================================
dpaste is a code pastebin application using Django.
===================================================

Originally inspired by dpaste.com this application adds the ability to:

    * See the differences between snippets
    * A history of snippets as a tree
    * See your latest 25 snippets (admin setting)
    * A huge bunch of syntax highlighters (lexers)
    * User defined settings to change the font-family as well as font-sizes
    * Nicer colors 
    * Multilangual interface

Requirements:
=============

    * django-mptt for the nested-set history tree
    * Pygments for syntax highlighting 

Todo/Maybe's:
=============

    * Ability to annotate lines
    * Make django-mptt and pygments optional
    * Permanently stored user settings 
    * An RPC-API to fetch snippets via VIM or so.

Example:
========
